# JAP-Levels
A few JAP Levels I made. See README.md to learn how to import into the JAP Level Editor.

# Level Use
Levels can be used without permission and can be copied and modified. (Create an issue/pr to suggest adding levels)

3. Go to the level in this repo you want to upload.
4. Copy it to your clipboard
5. Go back to the editor window, then press *Import Save*
6. Paste the level data, then hit enter.
7. The level will load.
