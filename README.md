# JAP-Levels
A few JAP Levels I made. See README.md to learn how to import into the JAP Level Editor.

# Level Use
Levels can be used without permission and can be copied and modified. (Create an issue/pr to suggest adding levels)

# Level Importing
1. Head over to the [JAP Level Editor](https://thetastypi.github.io/just-a-platformer/levelEditor/)
2. Click *Ctrl+F*
3. Go to the level in this repo you want to upload.
4. Copy it to your clipboard (use the copy button)
5. Go back to the editor window, then press *Import Save*
6. Paste the level data, then hit *enter*.
7. The level will load.

# Better Experience
For a better experience,
while **playing the level**, press *3* and *1*.
If you press *zero*, all fake textures will be shown. Use this as a sort of practice mode.

# Contribute to Levels
If you want to fix a bug or make a level better, follow these steps:
1. Make your changes. The editor is easy to learn.
2. Press *Ctrl+F*, this will open the save menu.
3. Find your level on the list, click *Rename*, then name it something (do not change if you are contributing to an existing level)
4. Now click *Export*, the level code will copy to your clipboard.
5. Fork this repo, create a branch named *Contribute*, then create a new file.
6. Name this file "Example Level.txt"
7. Create a pull request with the level title and the branch named *Contribute*.
8. I will playtest the level and if it's good, it will be added to the repo.
